# Michael Edidem

PhD Researcher | Spatial AI & Geospatial Machine Learning Engineer  
Southern Illinois University Carbondale

I work at the intersection of **Geospatial AI**, **hydrologic and environmental modeling**, and
**physics-guided machine learning**, developing scalable, data-driven systems for analyzing
groundwater–surface water interactions, elevation-derived hydrography, and environmental
decision-support workflows.

My work bridges **research and engineering**, translating advanced machine learning methods
into reproducible, high-performance geospatial pipelines.
